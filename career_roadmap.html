                                    Civil engineers who desire to work overseeing projects often become architectural
                                    and engineering managers. These individuals oversee all aspects of a project and
                                    manage teams of engineers working on the project. They make final decisions about
                                    what kinds of materials and staffing are required and they take responsibility for
                                    ensuring projects are done on time and on budget. Engineering managers confer with
                                    clients and upper management to ensure good communication about the project and they
                                    typically hold a Master's in Engineering Management or a Master's in Business
                                    Administration.
